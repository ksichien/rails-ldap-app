This is a personal project where I created a Ruby on Rails application for simplying modifications to my local LDAP server.
A user can log in with their LDAP mail address and password, which the application will also use to modify the LDAP tree.

There are various operations available:
- Add a user to group
- Create a new user
- Change an existing user's password
- Delete an existing user
- Remove a user from a group
- Search for all groups a user belongs to
